# File-checker-
This is a batch file which checks if the required file name and folders exist in a given zip file.

How is it useful?
If you need to get zip files from a large number of students/employees and check if the the required files are in the zip, you need to unzip each file and check if the required file is there or not. This batch scripts automates that stuff for you. You just need to run this batch script and all the students/employees who have not submitted the required files are directly recorded in a log file and you can just kick them for not submitting the appropriate file(Just kidding, pls dont do that)!!
